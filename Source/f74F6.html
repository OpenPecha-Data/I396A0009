	<h2>A Preliminary to the Explanation of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</h2>
<h3>Founders of Traditions, Explanatory SÅ«tras, Ways of Commenting, etc.</h3>
<p><strong><em>by Dzogchen Khenpo TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼</em></strong></p>
<p>Earlier Tibetan scholars believed that there were four initial founders of traditions related to the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ: </p>
<ol>
<li>the glorious protector noble NÄgÄrjuna,</li>
<li>ÄcÄrya DignÄga,</li>
<li>the author of <em>Bá¹haá¹­á¹­Ä«kÄ</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>Â and</li>
<li>the venerable lord Maitreya.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for proposing these as founders of traditions is that all four commented upon the intent of the Mother PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ without relying upon other commentaries.</p>
<h4>1. NÄgÄrjuna</h4>
<p>The great master NÄgÄrjuna elucidated the aspect of emptiness, the direct teaching of the prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, in the âFivefold Collection of MÄdhyamika Reasoningâ. These texts were written both to refute any true reality as something to be established, and to refute the logical reasonings that might establish it. With regard to the first, there is:</p>
<p>(1) the main body-like treatise, the <em>Root Verses of the Middle Way on Wisdom (MÅ«lamadhyamaka-kÄrikÄ)</em> that refutes groups from this (Buddhist) and other traditions.</p>
<p>Then there are the two subsidiary treatises derived from this:</p>
<p>(2) <em>The Refutation of Objections</em>, which is an expansion of the first section of the <em>Fundamental Verses</em> on âExamining Conditionsâ; and</p>
<p>(3) <em>The Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em>, which is an expansion of the seventh section of the <em>Fundamental Verses</em> on âExamining Arising, Dwelling and Ceasingâ.</p>
<p>Then there are:</p>
<p>(4) <em>Sixty Verses on Reasoning</em>, which is a refutation of some within our own (Buddhist) tradition in particular; and</p>
<p>(5) <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em>, which is a refutation of the establishing logic known as the âsixteen topics of the logicians.â</p>
<p>Thus there are five texts in the collection altogether.</p>
<p>Some followers of the older scholastic tradition in Tibet<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>Â added <em>Conventional Existence</em> to the other five, and some more recent scholars have added <em>Precious Garland (RatnÄvalÄ«)</em>. In this and other ways, they have asserted a âSixfold Collection of Reasoningâ, but as the Lord of Dharma Shyenpen pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âThe Master BhÄvaviveka said:</p>
<p>âThrough the texts known as <em>The Fundamental Verses</em>, <em>Refutation of Objections</em>,<br/>
<em>Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness</em>, <em>Sixty-verse Reasoning,</em><br/>
And <em>Crushing to Fine Powder</em>,<br/>
Things are established as beyond arising.ââ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he says, the number can certainly be put at five. And whilst the followers of the Gendenpa debate manuals count six by including <em>Jewel Garland</em>, this was not the assertion of Je Tsongkhapa himself, for he says in his <em>Golden Rosary</em>,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>Â âYou should understand that the belief in a fixed number of six texts in the Collection of Reasoning is erroneous.â</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discarding like hay the intent of Lobzang Drakpa,<br/>
The new Gelug works mislead the childish<br/>
With deceptive tricks of invention and false logicâ<br/>
Who with an honest mind would deem them trustworthy?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>2. DignÄga</h4>
<p>The ÄcÄrya DignÄga summarized the <em>Eight Thousand Verse</em> text into the 32 principle themes of the Mother PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ.</p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basis and that to be mastered,<br/>
Activity together with cultivation,<br/>
Division, sign and downfall,<br/>
Together with benefitâ<br/>
These are perfectly expressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basis is the teacher, the Lord Buddha (1). That to be mastered is the assembly of bodhisattvas and ÅrÄvakas (2). The activity is how to engage in the prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ (3). Cultivation refers to the ten antidotes to the ten uncritical and distracted concepts (13). Division refers to the sixteen emptinesses (29). Sign is the sign of not turning away from MÄra (30). Downfall is taking birth in the lower realms when abandoning the prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ (31). Benefit is the greater merit that is gained by such acts as writing out the prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, which surpasses an offering of the three-thousand-fold universe filled with the seven precious gems (32).</p>
<h4>3. The Author of <em>Bá¹haá¹­á¹­Ä«kÄ</em></h4>
<p>The elaborate explanation of the vast and intermediate Mother PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ texts and the <em>18,000 Verses</em> in the commentary <em>Bá¹haá¹­á¹­Ä«kÄ</em> explains the meaning of the Mother PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ by means of the three media and eleven categories.</p>
<p>The three media are:</p>
<p>1) The medium of the concise teaching for those who understand through stating the initial phrases;</p>
<p>2) The medium of the intermediate teaching for those who understand through slight elaboration; and</p>
<p>3) The medium of the elaborate explanation for those who are fond of words.</p>
<p>The eleven categories are the (1) explanation granted to ÅÄriputra; (2) the elaborate explanation by SubhÅ«ti; (3) the explanation granted to Åakra;<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> (4) SubhÅ«ti; (5) Maitreya; (6) SubhÅ«ti; (7) Åakra; (8) SubhÅ«ti; (9) Maitreya; (10) SubhÅ«ti; and (11) Ananda.</p>
<p>The old texts of past scholars say that <em>Bá¹haá¹­á¹­Ä«kÄ</em> was written by the Kashmiri Daá¹á¹£á¹­rÄsena. Some later scholars have claimed that there was some debate as to whether it is a commentary by Vasubandhu.</p>
<h4>4. Maitreya</h4>
<p>In the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>, the victorious Ajita<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>Â comments by combining the eight topics of the Mother PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ with seventy points.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that when DignÄga comments on the sÅ«tras establishing the principal point to be expressed from the summary of the <em>Eight Thousand Verses</em>, the antidotes to the ten distracted concepts, it is done according to <em>Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes</em>, and the way he comments upon the sÅ«tras on the three essential natures<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a>Â is according to <em>The MahÄyÄna Compendium</em>. So he has not founded a tradition that is distinct from [what is already in] the treatises of Maitreya.</p>
<p>The commentary <em>Bá¹haá¹­á¹­Ä«kÄ</em> too, by quoting from <em>The Fundamental Verses on Wisdom</em> in its ascertainment of emptiness and so on, remains in accordance with the intent of the Collection of Reasoning, and therefore cannot be thought of as initiating a separate tradition, distinct from that of NÄgÄrjuna.</p>
<p>Therefore, in keeping with the assertion of ÄcÄrya Dharmamitra, the founders of the commentarial traditions of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, are certainly two in number:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>NÄgÄrjuna, who elucidated the stages of emptiness, the direct teaching of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ SÅ«tras; and</p></li>
<li><p>Maitreya, who elucidated the hidden meaning, the stages of manifest realization.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, it is said that the founder of the tradition of the Profound Middle Way is the noble and sublime NÄgÄrjuna and the founder of the tradition of Vast Conduct is the noble Asaá¹ga. There are also those who assert three founders in accordance with the Lord of Dharma Mipham Rinpoche who was really MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, and who, in his commentary to the <em>Ornament of the Middle Way</em>, added to these two the great Khenpo ÅÄntaraká¹£ita as the founder of the tradition that united the Profound and the Vast. However, since these are the founders of the general traditions of the MahÄyÄna, they should not be confused with the topic presently under discussion.</p>
<p>At that time, the word âfounderâ [literally 'charioteer'] means one who has been directly prophesied by the Buddha himself as a founder of a tradition, and who is accepted by his or her chosen deity, like the foremost of the bodhisattvas Maitreya or MaÃ±juÅrÄ«, and who comments on the intent of the victorious ones independently, without relying upon any other commentary of human authorship.</p>
<p>Abu Patrul Rinpoche, in his <em>Trainings of the Buddhasâ Heirs</em>,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> follows the intent of the omniscient father and son<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a>Â as found in such works as the great omniscient oneâs root text and commentary to <em>Mind in Comfort and Ease</em> and the second omniscient oneâs root text and commentary to <em>The Treasury of Precious Qualities</em>. [In this regard, he mentions] the lineage of Profound View originating with NÄgÄrjuna; the lineage of Vast Conduct coming from ÅÄntideva; and the lineage of the Vast and Profound in Unity which comes from Asaá¹ga and Vasubandhu, as well as the complete bringing together of these three lineage traditions, which is praised in the writings of the omniscient father and son, and which is a special lineage tradition for a way of practice that brings together all the various stages of practice found in the general MahÄyÄna path, so that they are all included within the two types of precious bodhicitta. This is not to be confused with the general traditions, nor is there any conflict between them.</p>
<p>Generally, regarding the founders, there are also founders of the Hinayana traditions, and of the mantra traditions, so one cannot make a final and unequivocal decision that there were two or three.</p>
<p>It also appears that the Gelugpas recite in a particular prayer, âTsongkhapa, founder of the tradition of the Land of Snowsâ¦â Despite featuring in their recitations, this assertion is not to be found in any commentary of profound meaning.</p>
<p>Lobzang Phuntsok in his <em>Notes on the Expedient and Definitive</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on statements from [Je Tsongkhapaâs] <em>Golden Rosary</em>, such as âJetsÃ¼n [Maitreya] and NÄgÄrjuna bothâ¦â, it appears one or two scholars have claimed that Maitreya was the founder of a tradition. Yet if this is asserted because Maitreya clearly reveals the hidden meaning [of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ] in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>, then since the <em>SÅ«tralÄá¹kÄra</em> and the two texts of â<em>Distinguishing Clearly</em>â show the way of Mind Only, it would follow that Maitreya is also the founder of the Mind Only school. If one accepted that, then it would follow that Noble Asaá¹ga could not be [the founder of Mind Only], and one would be forced to assert something unaccepted by the majority of scholars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So by committing the mistake of not distinguishing between the scriptural Mind Only and the philosophical school of Mind Only what appears like a logical consequence only obscures the intent of the Lord [Tsongkhapa], and it becomes rather like Jamyang Sakya Paá¹á¸itaâs statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monkeys living in the forest,<br/>
Throwing muck at the trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maitreyaâs clear explication of the hidden meaning of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is proven by scripture and reasoning to be a new tradition of commentary unlike any before it.</p>
<p>As for the explanation in the style of Mind Only which features in the three intermediate works of Maitreya,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> called âscriptural Mind Onlyâ, this was also explained in NÄgÄrjunaâs <em>Sixty-fold Reasoning</em>, when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great elements and so on that are explained<br/>
Are perfectly subsumed within consciousness.<br/>
If one lacks that understanding<br/>
Is that not a mistaken analysis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one claims that the three intermediate works of Maitreya make clear the philosophical tenets of the Mind Only, then one should be able to identify which work amongst the three asserts an all-ground consciousness or a truly existent self-awareness. Since there is none, if you then say, âIt is so, because in our tradition we accept that these three intermediate works of Maitreya elucidate the tenets of Mind Onlyâ then that is not a valid proof. It is rather like when those who believe in the sentience of trees say to the Buddhists, âLet us consider a tree, it must possess a mind, because its leaves curl up at night when it sleeps.â</p>
<h3>The SÅ«tras that the AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra Explains</h3>
<p>Regarding the root sÅ«tras that are explained in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>, past writers have listed âseventeen mothers and sonsâ. There are said to be six âmother scripturesâ and eleven âson scripturesâ.</p>
<p>As the <em>Thang-yig</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hundred Thousand, Twenty-five [Thousand],<br/>
Eighteen Thousand, Wisdom in Ten Thousand,<br/>
Eight Thousand and Condensed are the six âmothersâ.<br/>
The SuvikrÄntavikrÄmÄ«-requested, Five Hundred PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ,<br/>
Diamond-Cutter, One Hundred and Fifty Modes,<br/>
KauÅika-Requested, Thirty, Twenty-five Doors,<br/>
Heart of Wisdom, Few Letters,<br/>
Single Letter, Four Groups of Piled Gems,<br/>
And the Seven Hundred Verses of Transcendent Wisdom are the eleven âsonsâ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentaries on the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ list the six âmothersâ just as they are given in the <em>Thang-yig</em>:</p>
<p>1) 100,000 Verses on Transcendent Wisdom (ÅatasÄhasrikÄ)</p>
<p>2) 25,000 Verses (PaÃ±caviá¹ÅatisÄhasrikÄ)</p>
<p>3) 18,000 Verses (Aá¹£á¹­adaÅasÄhasrikÄ)</p>
<p>4) 10,000 Verses (DaÅasÄhasrikÄ)</p>
<p>5) 8,000 Verses (Aá¹£á¹­asÄhasrikÄ)</p>
<p>6) Condensed (Saá¹caya)</p>
<p>The eleven âsonsâ are:</p>
<p>1) 700 Verses on Transcendent Wisdom (SaptaÅatikÄ)</p>
<p>2) 500 Verses (PaÃ±caÅatikÄ)</p>
<p>3) 300 Verses (TriÅatikÄ)</p>
<p>4) 150 Modes (NayaÅatapaÃ±cÄÅatikÄ)</p>
<p>5) 50 Verses</p>
<p>6) 25 Doors (PaÃ±caviá¹Åati)</p>
<p>7) Requested by SuvikrÄntavikrÄmÄ« (SuvikrÄntavikrÄmÄ«paripá¹cchÄ)</p>
<p>8) Requested by KauÅika</p>
<p>9) Few Letters of Transcendent Wisdom (SvalpÄká¹£arÄ)</p>
<p>10) Single Letter of Transcendent Wisdom (EkÄká¹£arÄ«)</p>
<p>11) The Heart of Wisdom (PrajÃ±Ähá¹daya)</p>
<p>Regarding the criteria for classifying these as either âmotherâ or âsonâ scriptures, sÅ«tras revealing the eight manifest realizations are termed âmotherâ scriptures, whilst those revealing them only partially are termed âsonâ.</p>
<p>As for the objection raised by some later scholars<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a>Â who dispute this enumeration of seventeen âmothersâ and âsonsâ, it is tantamount to opposing the Buddha himself, for it is stated in <em>The SÅ«tra Requested by KauÅika</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The BhagavÄn remained on Vulture Peak Mountain, on the occasion of completing the seventeen âmothersâ and âsonsâ of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When refuted by this quotation, to then object that this sÅ«tra was not taught by the Buddha is a deprecation reminiscent of the Chinese scholar Hva-shang taking whichever sÅ«tras contradicted his own position and rolling them under his feetâ besides amassing the severe karma of rejecting the Dharma, there can be no valid reason for it. There is absolutely no logical flaw in applying the convention of seventeen âmotherâ and âsonâ scriptures. If one applies the name âseventeen mother and son scripturesâ to group together seventeen prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras taught together by the Buddha, this does not imply that he did not teach any other PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras.</p>
<p>It might be said, âIt is unreasonable to fix the number of PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras at seventeen, because this has the fault of being too few, since it omits such sÅ«tras as <em>The Heart of the Sun PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</em>, <em>The Heart of the Moon</em>, <em>The SÅ«tra Requested by Samantabhadra</em>, <em>The SÅ«tra Requested by VajrapÄá¹i</em> and <em>The SÅ«tra Requested by Vajrakeá¹­u</em>,<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> and also has the fault of being too many because <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em> is actually one chapter of the 18,000 Verse text, and if that is to be counted separately so should the other chapters.â Although this appears logical, it would follow that it is equally unreasonable for you to fix the number of PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras at three, i.e. vast, intermediate and condensed, since this too would not include [all the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras], and you yourselves have already accepted this line of reasoning.</p>
<p>Then you might say, âWe are not saying definitively that there are no other PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras in general besides these three, but we are counting these three as the main PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras amongst the principal sÅ«tras explained in the <em>Abhisamayalankara</em>, so there is no fault.â But this is just the same as when those [who assert seventeen mother and son scriptures] say that they do not claim these seventeen to be the only PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras, but the seventeen principal sÅ«tras explained in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>.</p>
<p>It is indeed true that <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em> is a single chapter of the <em>18,000 Verse</em> text, but it is not necessarily equal to the other chapters. One should perhaps consider why there are three commentaries that connect the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> with <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em>, but none that connect the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> with any other chapter. To consider that they are equal in what they express simply because they are similar in being chapters is the sort of thinking that leads one to believe a fox and a lion are the same since they are both equal in being wild creatures, or that a thought and a vase are the same since they are both knowable phenomena!</p>
<p>One should not think, âThe sÅ«tras explained in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> must be just the vast, intermediate and condensed sÅ«tras, and it is unacceptable to state this about any other of the seventeen mother and son scriptures because that would conflict with the <em>Clear MeaningÂ </em> commentary [by Haribhadra].â Statements in <em>Clear Meaning</em> such as âThe ornament of allâ and âThe discovery of treatises like this is wondrous indeed!â, can only mean that the sublime <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> is made more sublime by being the ornament of all the Mother PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄs, and that apart from increasing its value it does not constitute any defect whatsoever.</p>
<p>One should reflect carefully why, if it is especially sublime since it is understood as the ornament of the main three PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras, it should not be made more sublime by being understood as the ornament of the main seventeen PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras.</p>
<p>Therefore, the main basic sÅ«tras that are explained in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> are the six âmotherâ scriptures because they are the sÅ«tras to which the subject matter of the <em>Abhisamayalankara</em>, i.e. the stages of manifest realization, can be applied. This is clear from the presence of actual Indian commentaries that combine the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> with the <em>100,000 Verses</em>, the <em>25,000 Verses</em>, the <em>8,000 Verses</em> and <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em>. In his <em>Overview of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</em>, the gentle-voiced Abu (Patrul Rinpoche) makes the point that because <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em> is combined, the <em>18,000 Verses</em> is also combined indirectly, and it is evident that the <em>10,000 Verse PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</em> text is also suitable for combinationâand that is just how it is. Therefore, the eleven âsonâ scriptures and so on are ordinary sÅ«tras that are explained.</p>
<p>In short, whether one considers the sÅ«tras explained in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> to be the vast, intermediate and condensed sÅ«tras or the seventeen âmotherâ and âsonâ scriptures, it is indeed true that these can not be said with certainty to be the only PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras in general, or the only sÅ«tras explained in the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> in particular. I do not think there is any contradiction in such claims.</p>
<h3>The Twenty-one Indian Commentaries</h3>
<p>There are twelve commentaries which combine sÅ«tras with the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>, and nine which do not. Among the former group, four use the <em>25,000 Verses</em>, three use the <em>8,000 Verse</em> text, three use <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em>, one uses the <em>100,000 Verses</em>, and one uses the three texts of the <em>100,000 Verses</em>, the <em>25,000</em> and the <em>8,000</em>.</p>
<p>Firstly, the four are:</p>
<p>1) Ärya Vimuktisenaâs <em>Illuminating the 25,000 Verses</em></p>
<p>2) Bhadanta<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a>Â Vimuktisenaâs <em>Commentary on the 25,000</em></p>
<p>3) ÄcÄrya Haribhadraâs <em>Eight Chapters on the 25,000</em></p>
<p>4) RatnÄkaraÅÄntiâs <em>Pure 25,000 (ÅuddhamatÄ«)</em></p>
<p>Secondly, the three are:</p>
<p>1) ÄcÄrya Haribhadraâs <em>Light Ornament: A Great Commentary on the 8,000 Verses</em></p>
<p>2) RatnÄkaraÅÄntiâs <em>Supreme Essence (SÄrottamÄ)</em></p>
<p>3) AbhayÄkaraguptaâs <em>Moonlight of Points (MarmakaumudÄ«)</em></p>
<p>Third, the three are:</p>
<p>1) ÄcÄrya Haribhadraâs <em>Easy-to-Comprehend Commentary on the Difficult Points of the Condensed SÅ«tra</em></p>
<p>2) BuddhaÅrÄ«jÃ±Änaâs <em>Commentary on the Difficult Points of the Condensed SÅ«tra</em></p>
<p>3) Kashmiri DharmaÅrÄ«âs <em>Key to the Treasury of Transcendent Wisdom</em></p>
<p>Fourth, there is:</p>
<p>1) <em>Explanation of the 100,000</em> said to be by Kashmiri DharmaÅrÄ«.</p>
<p>Fifth:</p>
<p>1) <em>Teaching on the Three Renowned âMotherâ Scriptures in Conformity with the Eight Points</em> said to be by Lord Smá¹tijÃ±ÄnakÄ«rti.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are the nine which do not connect [the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>] with sÅ«tras:</p>
<p>1) ÄcÄrya Haribhadraâs <em>Clear Meaning Commentary</em> <a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a></p>
<p>2) Dharmamitraâs <em>Explanatory Commentary Clarifying the Words</em></p>
<p>3) SuvarnadvÄ«paâs <em>Light on the Difficult-to-Comprehend</em></p>
<p>4), 5) and 6) PrajÃ±Äkaramatiâs, Lord AtiÅaâs and KumÄraÅrÄ«bhadraâs <em>Three Essential Meanings</em></p>
<p>7) RatnakÄ«rtiâs <em>KÄ«rtikala</em></p>
<p>8) Kashmiri BuddhaÅrÄ«jÃ±Änaâs <em>Rosary of Liberating Wisdom</em></p>
<p>9) AbhayÄkaraguptaâs <em>Ornament of the Sageâs Realization</em></p>
<p>Among these, <em>The Explanatory Commentary</em> <em>Clarifying the Words</em>, <em>Light on the Difficult-to-Comprehend</em>, and PrajÃ±akaramatiâs <em>Essential Meaning</em> are commentaries on [Haribhadraâs] <em>Clear Meaning Commentary</em>.</p>
<p>It is explained in Drukpa Pema Karpoâs commentary on the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ that Haribhadra and PrajÃ±Äkaramati both saw Maitreya directly, and that Dharmamitra saw him in a dream.</p>
<p>Some assert that <em>The Ascertainment of Suchness</em> written by Noble Asaá¹ga is a commentary that combines sÅ«tra and <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>, and some even say that the <em>Clear Meaning Commentary</em> is a commentary combining sÅ«tra and <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>. This would mean that the number of commentaries combining sÅ«tras and <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> could not be fixed definitively at twelve, but since this would contradict what is generally accepted, it requires investigation. Scholars may take as an issue for further investigation the question of whether Kashmiri BuddhaÅrÄ«âs <em>100,000 Verse Commentary</em>, Smá¹tijÃ±Änakirtiâs work on the <em>Three Mother Scriptures in Comformity with the Eight Points</em>, and AtiÅaâs <em>Lamp of Essential Meaning</em> are to be classified as the works of Indian Paá¹á¸itas or Tibetan Scholars.</p>
<p>Concerning which of those amongst these commentaries are particularly sublime, the great learned and accomplished PrajÃ±ÄraÅmi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The progressive path from the hidden meaning of the middle turning,<br/>
Was elucidated by the Dharma Lord Ajita in Tuá¹£ita.<br/>
In the Noble Land [of India] there were six transmissions<br/>
And many ways of commenting upon the intent of the Ornament,<br/>
But those commentaries of Ärya [Vimuktisena] and Haribhadra are especially sublime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as he says, one should rely mainly upon the commentaries of Vimuktisena and Haribhadra.</p>
<h3>Works of the Ancient Translation School</h3>
<p>The great omniscient MahÄpaá¹á¸ita Shenpen ChÃ¶kyi Nangwaâs annotation commentary (<em>mchan âgrel</em>) on <em>The Clear Meaning Commentary</em> also makes reference to Dharmamitraâs <em>Explanatory Commentary Clarifying the Words</em>, and SuvarnadvÄ«paâs <em>Light on the Difficult-to-Comprehend</em>, as well as Acharya Haribhadraâs <em>Light Ornament</em>, RatnÄkaraÅÄntiâs <em>Pure 20,000</em> and others. It does not spoil the intent of the Indian commentaries and is unadulterated by even the slightest assertion from a Tibetan scholar. The tradition of expounding this has been maintained and developed by successive khenpos at the seat of the great and accomplished Lord of DokhamâDzogchenâwhere it has not declined even to this day.</p>
<p>The second throne-holder of Mindroling Pema Gyurme Gyatso<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> wrote an overview of the <em>Commentary Clarifying the Meaning</em> called <em>The Quintessence of Nectar</em> (<em>bdud rtsi'i nying khu</em>) that accords with the commentary of the great Sakya scholar RongtÃ¶n. This fits with the saying of many early scholars that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Vinaya goes back to Tso,<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a><br/>
The Abhidharma goes back to Chim,<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a><br/>
The Madhyamaka goes back to Re[ndawa],<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a><br/>
The PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ goes back to Yak.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dharma Lord Patrul Rinpoche composed an <em>Overview of the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</em>, a <em>Word-by-word Commentary</em> and <em>Progressive Stages of Meditation</em>, which accord with the <em>Golden Rosary</em> commentary of the great JetsÃ¼n Tsongkhapa. Regarding the use of JetsÃ¼n Tsongkhapaâs commentary as a basis, the great Dzogchen khenpos always used to say that since this was [actually] Omniscient Longchenpaâs PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ commentary, it remains purely an explication of the Ancient Translations school.</p>
<p>Jamyang Mipham Rinpoche composed a commentary on <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em> which takes the Ancient Translations tradition as its basis, an application of the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em> to <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em>, and a commentary on the <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>. The commentary of his follower, the supremely learned BÃ¶pa Tulku,<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[19]</a> is now being spread by his own students.</p>
<p>I have spoken at length here so as to inspire confidence in those newcomers [to this tradition].</p>
<p>In short, the pure explanations of the Ancient Translation school belong to the scriptural tradition of the Six Ornaments and Two Supreme Ones,<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[20]</a> together with their followers. These are the scriptures that were established in the past through translation, explanation and study by the lotsawas and paá¹á¸itas of India and Tibet during the era of Khenpo ÅÄntaraká¹£ita, ÄcÄrya Padmasambhava and Dharma-king Trisong Detsen. At that time, these same works were taught and studied by those who began the thirteen great centres of learning, such as the study college (<em>shedra</em>) at the glorious Samye. This also refers to the works composed by the two victorious ones, Rongzom and Longchenpa, in addition to those of the omniscient Jamyang Mipham in this tradition of the Nyingma.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the Nyingmapas themselves to feel that their assertions must be quite unlike those of anyone else, or for others to consider them as incompatible with any other system is simply to flaunt the signs of oneâs own misunderstanding, and is not even worthy of investigation. So whether one belongs to this tradition or another, one should feel wary about accumulating the karma of rejecting the Dharma, by following after unsubstantiated claims, which are like the warning cries of the rabbit who heard a falling branch in the well-known story. Nevertheless, this is not the time for me to explain the many profound qualities of the special instructions of the Kama, Terma and Pure Vision traditions of secret mantra.</p>
<p><em>This was a preliminary to the teaching and study of the Ornament,</em><br/>
<em>Identifying the founders of traditions based on the PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ sÅ«tras,</em><br/>
<em>Which sÅ«tras are explained in the AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra,</em><br/>
<em>And the Ornamentâs Indian commentaries.</em></p>
<p>By VÄ«rya.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[21]</a></p>
<p><em>Composed by the first Khenpo at the Ngagyur Nyingma Instituteâs centre for the study of sÅ«tra and mantra, Khen Rinpoche Thubten TsÃ¶ndru.</em></p>
<p><em>May virtue abound!</em></p>

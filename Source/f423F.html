	<h2>The Words of Jigme ChÃ¶kyi Wangpo</h2>
<h2>A Commentary Presenting the Subject Matter of the Great Treatise, <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em></h2>
<p><strong><em>by Khenpo TsÃ¶ndrÃ¼</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Oá¹ Svasti!</em></p>
<p><em>The great Sage and Lord of Dharma, Maitreya and MaÃ±jughoá¹£a,</em><br/>
<em>The three founders NÄgÄrjuna, Asaá¹ga and ÅÄntaraká¹£ita,</em><br/>
<em>Rongzom, Longchenpa, Jigme ChÃ¶kyi Wangpo and the restâ</em><br/>
<em>Gracious root and lineage masters, grant me your protection!</em></p>
<p>I will now present an overview of the main body of the great treatise known as <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>, as it is taught in the fifteen verses,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>Â following the explanation of Jigme ChÃ¶kyi Wangpo (Patrul Rinpoche).</p>
<p>In this, there are two main sections:</p>
<p>I. Briefly presenting the main body of the text by means of its principal subject to be elucidated, i.e. the eight topics; and</p>
<p>II. Elaborately explaining the body of the text by means of the seventy points that elucidate [the eight topics].</p>
<h2>I. EIGHT TOPICS</h2>
<p>This is also divided into a brief presentation and more elaborate explanation.</p>
<h3>1. Brief Presentation</h3>
<p>As it is said:<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The transcendent perfection of wisdom (prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ)<br/>
Is perfectly explained by means of the eight topics.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say that the subject to be explained is the prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, and the means of explanation, which will explain it perfectly, are the eight topics.</p>
<p>The prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ that is referred to here can be understood by means of the following five aspects: a) its literal meaning, b) its definition, c) illustrations, d) subdivisions, and e) the actual versus the nominal.</p>
<h4>a) Literal Meaning</h4>
<p>As it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âIt is the best (<em>pra</em>; <em>rab</em>) of all knowledge (<em>jÃ±Ä</em>; <em>shes pa</em>), so it is wisdom (<em>prajÃ±Ä</em>; <em>shes rab</em>). It is focused upon the absolute, and is the most sublime among all forms of wisdom, therefore it is transcendent (<em>pÄram</em>; <em>pha rol</em>), and it has arrived at, or will lead one to (<em>itÄ</em>; <em>phyin</em>), non-abiding nirvÄá¹a.â<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>b) Definition</h4>
<p>PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is the wisdom of directly realizing the non-conceptual simplicity (<em>spros bral</em>) of all phenomena, which has arrived at, or will lead one to, non-abiding nirvÄá¹a.</p>
<h4>c)Â Illustration</h4>
<p>Any aspect of realizationâgained through the three noble paths<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> of the mahÄyÄnaâinto the absence of true reality in all phenomena.</p>
<h4>d)Â Subdivisions</h4>
<p>The term [prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ] can refer to any of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>natural prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</li>
<li>scriptural prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</li>
<li>path prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</li>
<li>resultant prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Their respective definitions and parameters are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Natural prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is defined as the objective aspects of the wisdom that directly realizes the non-conceptual simplicity of all phenomena. It is synonymous with the ground prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ.</p>
<p>Parameters: It is present on the three noble paths of the mahÄyÄna.</p>
<p>2. Scriptural prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is defined as any scriptureâwhether the Buddhaâs own words or a treatiseâwhose primary topic of expression is the ground, path or resultant prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ. It is insight (<em>rnam par rig pa</em>) manifesting as the teachersâ words, expressions and letters. Illustrations include the seventeen âmotherâ and âsonâ prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ texts as well as <em>AbhisamayÄlaá¹kÄra</em>.</p>
<p>Parameters: It is present from before the path is entered until enlightenment.</p>
<p>3. Path prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is defined as the wisdom that directly realizes the non-conceptual simplicity of all phenomena and leads to non-abiding nirvÄá¹a. Illustrations are the five mahÄyÄna paths, especially the paths of seeing, meditation and the final path (i.e. the path of no-more-learning).</p>
<p>Parameters: The actual path prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is present in the equipoise of the noble followers of the mahÄyÄna, whilst a semblance of it is to be found in the mindstreams of those on the paths of accumulation and joining.</p>
<p>4. Resultant prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is defined as the wisdom which has arrived at non-abiding nirvÄá¹a, the ultimate and most supreme direct realization of the non-conceptual simplicity of all phenomena. An illustration is the magical wisdom of non-duality at the level of buddhahood.</p>
<p>Parameters: It is present only in the continuum of a noble Buddha.</p>
<h4>e) The Actual Versus the Nominal</h4>
<p>ÄcÄrya DignÄga says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PrajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is non-dual wisdom,<br/>
The very state of a tathÄgata.<br/>
Yet since they have this as their objective,<br/>
The term is also applied to the scriptures and the path.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he states, the ground prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ and resultant prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ are the actual (or definitive) prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, whereas the scriptural prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ is merely given the name of prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ, and the path prajÃ±ÄpÄramitÄ has aspects of both the actual and the nominal.</p>
<h3>2. Elaborate Explanation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge of all aspects, knowledge of the path,<br/>
Then the knowledge of all,<br/>
Completely perfect realization of all aspects,<br/>
Reaching the summit, the progressive,<br/>
Complete and perfect awakening in a single moment,<br/>
And the dharmakÄyaâthese are the eight topics.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it says, the eight topics are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge of all aspects, which is to be attained</li>
<li>Knowledge of the path, which is the means of attainment</li>
<li>Knowledge of the bases, which is to be abandoned</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the three aspects of wisdom that are to be known.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. Application of all aspects<br/>
5. Culminating application</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the cause and effect of gaining proficiency (<em>dbang du bya ba</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6. Progressive application<br/>
7.Â Instantaneous application</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two are the cause and effect of stability.</p>
<p>Taken together, these last four are the four applications of practice.</p>
<p>The result of practising in such a way is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8. DharmakÄya</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus eight are taught.</p>
<p>Each of these is explained according to its definition, illustrations, subdivisions, parameters, definite number, sequence and a denial of any repetition.</p>
<h4>1. Knowledge of All Aspects (or Omniscience)</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Knowledge of all aspects (or omniscience) is defined as knowing directly, and in a single instant, all aspects, without exception, of things in their real nature and in all their multiplicity.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>It can be subdivided into the omniscience which knows the nature of things and the omniscience which knows all things in their multiplicity. An illustration of the former is the true cessation present in the continuum of the noble Buddha. The latter includes both the omniscience which knows the features of all knowable phenomena without exception, and the omniscience which knows the seventy points, the chief amongst all causes and effects.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present only in the continuum of a noble Buddha.</p>
<h4>2. Path-Knowledge</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Path-knowledge is defined as the path of training that will lead us to realize the authentic limit of reality, once we have realized that the three paths are without any true reality and have perfected, matured and purified.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>When divided, there is the path-knowledge that knows the path of the ÅrÄvakas, the path-knowledge that knows the pratyekabuddha path, and the path-knowledge that knows the path of the bodhisattvas.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present on the five paths of the mahÄyÄna. It is also taught that it is present from the mahÄyÄna path of seeing until the state of awakening.</p>
<h4>3. Base-Knowledge</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Base-knowledge is defined as the limited knowledge that realizes all bases to be empty of the self of the individual.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>When the actual [base-knowledge] is sub-divided, there is the base-knowledge of the ÅrÄvakas and that of the pratyekabuddhas.</p>
<p>If divisions are made according to how the term is applied, there are five: the base-knowledge that abides in neither existence nor quiescence, the base-knowledge that is distant from the âresultant motherâ,<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> the base-knowledge that is close to the âresultant motherâ, the base-knowledge that is unfavourable and the base-knowledge that is a remedy.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>The actual base-knowledge is present on the five paths of the hinayÄna, but all the noble ones of the mahÄyÄna possess the nominal base-knowledge. It is also said that it is present in the mind-stream of all noble ones.</p>
<h4>4. Complete Application of All Aspects</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Complete application of all aspects is defined as the bodhisattvasâ yoga<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> of meditation in which one brings together the three types of non-arising in order to master the realization of the threefold knowledge.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a></p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>When divided in terms of its essence and so on, there are twenty applications, and when divided in terms of its aspects, there are 173 subdivisions.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present from the lesser path of accumulation until the end of the tenth bhÅ«mi.</p>
<h4>5. Culminating Application</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Culminating application is defined as the bodhisattvasâ yoga that is based on the complete application of all aspects in which one has gained proficiency in the meditation combining the three types of non-arising.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>There are eight subdivisions: the four culminating applications of ordinary beings, the three culminating applications of the noble ones, and the mistaken practice to be eliminated.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present from the stage of warmth until the end of the tenth bhÅ«mi.</p>
<h4>6. Progressive Application</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Progressive application is defined as the bodhisattvasâ yoga in which one meditates on the aspects of the threefold knowledge sequentially in order to stabilize the realization in which the knowledge aspects of the threefold knowledge arise all at once.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>There are thirteen subdivisions: the progressive applications of the six transcendent perfections, the six recollections<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> and essential unreality.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present mainly as an object of study and reflection from the path of accumulation onwards. The application produced through meditation is present from the stage of warmth [on the path of joining] until the end of the tenth bhÅ«mi.</p>
<h4>7. Instantaneous Application</h4>
<h4>Definition</h4>
<p>Instantaneous application is defined as the bodhisattvasâ yoga in which one reaches the culmination of the progressive meditation on the threefold knowledge.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>Merely in terms of conceptual distinctions, it has four subdivisions.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a></p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present only at the end of the tenth bhÅ«mi.</p>
<h4>8. Resultant dharmakÄya</h4>
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<p>The resultant dharmakÄya is defined as the ultimate fruition of practising the four applications, endowed with various undefiling qualities.</p>
<h4>Subdivisions</h4>
<p>It has four subdivisions: svÄbhÄvikakÄya, wisdom dharmakÄya, sambhogakÄya and nirmÄá¹akÄya.</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>It is present only at the level of buddhahood.</p>
<h4>Definite Number</h4>
<p>For an individual to awaken there must certainly be these three: the three aspects of knowledge to be known, the four applications of the path to be practised, and the result which is the dharmakÄya.</p>
<p><em>The Summarizing Lamp</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three knowledges as objects to be understood,<br/>
Four applications at the time of meditation,<br/>
And the ultimate result that is dharmakÄya.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the three aspects of knowledge are certainly three in numberâthe knowledge of all aspects which is to be attained, the path-knowledge which is the means of attainment, and the base-knowledge which is a potential pitfall.</p>
<p>Jowo Je, Glorious AtiÅa said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of study and reflection,<br/>
There is complete ascertainment of the result,<br/>
The cause and any unfavourable factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The four applications too are fixed in number. There is the complete application of all aspects, the cause for gaining proficiency, which causes one to develop qualities that had not previously arisen in oneâs mind, and its result, the culminating application. Then there is the progressive application, the cause for gaining stability, which enhances what has already arisen, and its result, the instantaneous application.</p>
<p><em>The Summarizing Lamp</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of meditation there is application,<br/>
Gaining temporary results, finding stability,<br/>
And perfection by reaching the limits of the causal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of such practice is also fixed in number as the single dharmakÄya.</p>
<h4>Sequence</h4>
<p>The sequence of the threefold knowledge is based on how they are explained, the sequence of the four applications is based on practice. The four applications and the dharmakÄya are given in the sequence of cause and effect.</p>
<h4>Denial of any Repetition</h4>
<p>There is no repetition between the threefold knowledge and the complete application of all aspects, because the three knowledges each have their own particular aspects, whereas the complete application of all aspects is concerned with all aspects without exception. Moreover, since the first is taught as something to be known through various definitions and the second is taught as something to be applied in practice, they are not simply repetitions of the same thing. Yet again, there is no repetition since the first is presented as an object for understanding the nature of total peace and the second is given as a remedy by means of which one overcomes impurities.</p>
<p>The explanation of the various bhÅ«mis and the paths of seeing and meditation in the context of the knowledge of all aspects and then their explanation in the context of the path-knowledge serve different purposes, and therefore there is no repetition. In the first case the explanation is given to illustrate the subject, the knowledge of all aspects, whereas in the second case it is given to illustrate the path-knowledge that knows the three paths by pointing out its objects.</p>
<p>The explanation of the ÅrÄvaka and pratyekabuddha paths given in the section on path-knowledge is intended to illustrate the subject, path-knowledge. When they are explained in the section on base-knowledge, it is to point out the base-knowledge that is a remedy by means of which one can be free from conceptual projections. In the first case, the paths ofÂ  the ÅrÄvakas and pratyekabuddhas are taught indirectly by pointing out their opposites, and in the second case they are taught in their own right, so there is no repetition.</p>
<p>There is no repetition between the knowledge of all aspects and the dharmakÄya, since they are taught by means of objects and result, or by means of illustration and essence respectively.</p>
<h2>II. THE SEVENTY POINTS</h2>
<p>Secondly, there is the elaborate explanation of the body of the text by means of the seventy points.</p>
<h3>1. The Ten Factors that Illustrate Omniscience</h3>
<p>It is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generation of bodhicitta, spiritual instructions,<br/>
The four branches of definite separation,<br/>
The foundation of accomplishmentâ<br/>
The nature of the dharmadhÄtu,<br/>
The objects of focus, the objective,<br/>
The armour, the activities of engagement,<br/>
Accumulation, and definite emergenceâ<br/>
These are the Sageâs knowledge of all aspects.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it says, there are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The generation of bodhicitta, which is the nature of the mahÄyÄna path,</li>
<li>The spiritual instructions, which are the method for attaining its objective,</li>
<li>The four aspects of definite separation, which come about as a result of the instructions,</li>
<li>The Buddha potential, the nature of the dharmadhÄtu, which is the basis for attaining accomplishment by practising the instructions unerringly,</li>
<li>The objects of focus for the practice,</li>
<li>The objective of the practice,</li>
<li>Armour-like practice,</li>
<li>Accomplishing the activities of engagement,</li>
<li>The practice of accumulation, and</li>
<li>The practice of definite emergence.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These ten factors point out the nature of omniscience, showing the result by means of its causes, or the subject by means of its objects, and mentioning the most important things to be understood.</p>
<p>The venerable Lord (AtiÅa) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of perfecting the ten causes, omniscience itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The [PramÄá¹a]vÄrttika says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing through this the total number of insects<br/>
Holds no purpose for us whatsoever.<br/>
It makes known the points to be adopted or avoided,<br/>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>The aspects belonging to the subject are possessed only by a buddha, but the aspects that exist for the objects of their activity are present even before one enters the path.</p>
<p><em>This presentation of the subject matter of the great treatise,<br/>
Is based on pure scriptural authority and some logical investigation.<br/>
Through the slight merit gained by means of this composition<br/>
May we be swiftly accepted as followers of the Invincible Lord!<a href="#fn:66" id="fnref:66" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[66]</a><br/>
In all our lives may our discipline be as pure as the inside of a lotus,<br/>
May we be rich with the wealth of study, reflection and meditation and the three trainings,<br/>
And through our unparalleled activity in explanation, debate and composition,<br/>
May we be of service to the teachings of the Buddha!</em></p>

<li id="fn:57">
<p>1) Believing that the mental focus produced by the teaching on how all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena are devoid of reality is untenable because if it were tenable, it would be an object of dualistic perception. 2) Believing the method of realizing that all phenomena lack true reality is untenable because if there is a mode of realization there must be something that is realized. 3) Believing omniscient wisdom to be untenable because it is said that it does not focus on real or unreal entities, yet if it is omniscient it must have these two objects. 4) Believing the relative and absolute truths to be untenable because it is taught that in the essence of reality itself they are indivisible, and yet if there are two they must be separable. 5) Believing the trainings in generosity and so on to be untenable because it is taught that one should not conceive of a giver, gift or recipient, and yet if there is an object there must be all three. 6) Believing that the Jewel of the realized Buddha is untenable because it is taught that there is nothing to be realized. 7) Believing that the Jewel of the Dharma is untenable because it is taught that cessation and the path are merely imputations. 8) Believing that the Jewel of the Sangha is untenable because it is taught that all phenomena are beyond development and reduction. 9) Believing that a subject having skilful methods such as generosity is untenable because it is taught that there should be no conceptual focus on subject, object or action. 10) Believing that the Buddhaâs realization is untenable because realization of real things, unreal things, both and neither is refuted. 11) Believing it is untenable to label the perception of the aggregates and so on as permanent and so on, because it is taught that notions such as permanent and impermanent are similar in being mere conceptual elaboration. 12) Believing the teaching that the bodhisattvas meditate on all three paths is untenable because it is taught that they do not manifest the fruition, the nirvÄá¹a of the ÅrÄvakas and pratyekabuddhas. 13) Believing that the antidote is untenable because it is taught that there is nothing to adopt. 14) Believing that adverse factors are untenable because it is taught that there is nothing to abandon. 15) Believing that general and uncommon characteristics are untenable because it is taught that all phenomena are beyond characteristics and illustration. 16) Believing that practising a path with the attainment of omniscience as its objective is untenable because that which is to be cultivated lacks general and specific characteristics. <a href="#fnref:57" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
